Hello how are you doing today
What is the weather going to be today
I am hungry and want to go home
Have you seen my keys
Can you please pass the salt
Where did you go after work
Let's meet at the park tomorrow
Did you watch the game last night
It's such a beautiful day
I'll be there in a few minutes
What time does the movie start
I love spending time with my friends
This is a great book
How's your day going
Let's have dinner together tonight
I can't find my phone
What's your favorite movie
I'm looking for a new job
Can you give me a hand
Let's go for a walk in the park
What's for dinner tonight
I'll call you later
Do you have any plans for the weekend
I need to buy some groceries
Where's the nearest coffee shop
